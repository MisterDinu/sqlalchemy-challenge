# sqlalchemy-challenge

Hello! I actually struggled a lot with this challenge, and had a lot of activities in my life, so I wasnt able
to ask for any help, but I managed to get this challenge done, I hope it still get a grade for this.
Just a little warning, when running de app.py do not use F5 to run it, I dont know why it doesnt work and says
operational error, but when clicking on the play button from top right in VSCode, it works with no problems.

Here I put all the references I used.
